excerpt: 'Synopsis: This paper tackles the challenge of creating semantic sketch videos by proposing a novel optimization framework. It uses frame-wise BÃ©zier curves, initialized across frames and optimized with CLIP-based semantic loss and a new 2D atlas consistency loss. The resulting sketch videos exhibit strong visual abstraction and temporal coherence, enabling applications like sketch-based video editing and doodling.'
